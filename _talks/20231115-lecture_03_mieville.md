Automation and algorithms are the two faces of digital chemistry. 
In this talk, we will explore the potential application of different 
families of algorithms along with the automated workflow of a data-driven
synthetic and analytical laboratory, as currently established at the
Swiss CAT+ West Hub at EPFL.
