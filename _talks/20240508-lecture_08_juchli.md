Daniel will speak about the latest developments of SiLA2 and presents the "Smart Building Blocks for the digital lab" where
he puts special focus on the <b>𝐏𝐀𝐂-𝐈𝐃<\b>, the "EAN" barcode for the laboratory. PAC-IDs can identify materials, devices, reports
and result, in conjunction with a PAC-ID resolver they significantly improve user experience. On resolver, the <b>𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐧<\b> app
that can be downloaded from android and iOS app-stores will be presented. It supports <b>𝐓-𝐑𝐄𝐗<\b> – <b>𝐭<\b>rivial <b>𝐫<\b>ecord <b>𝐞𝐱<\b>change – another
smart building block for the lab: a novel, light-weight method for simple data transfer between (legacy) devices and ELN/LIMS.
The smart building blocks are a prefect extension to SiLA2 communication as they are light-weight, open, and de-centralized.
