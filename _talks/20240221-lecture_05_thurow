Automation has reached ever larger areas recently. Due to the development of numerous new, 
cost-effective automation devices and modules, the automation of laboratory processes is 
also of increasing interest for small and medium-sized companies and in research laboratories. 
Different degrees of automation, from the automation of individual sub-steps to partial automation 
and finally full automation without manual intervention by an operator, are possible. 
The selection of a suitable automation concept depends on various factors. 
In addition to the process itself, which with its sub-processes sets the requirements and 
framework conditions for automation, other parameters such as space requirements, investment 
and operating expenses, planned operating times and throughput are also important.
Different automation concepts will be shown with exemplarily applications.
