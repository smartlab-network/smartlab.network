The most sought-after skills in new graduates have changed and now is the time to equip
your students with the knowledge they need to land jobs. We will ll share case studies of
university teachers who have incorporated automation into their courses and how this can
be done even if you do not have automation experience yourself. We will show ways to 
include robotics on a budget, and approaches to modifying existing lessons.
