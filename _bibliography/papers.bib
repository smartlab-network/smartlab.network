   abstractNote={The interaction of the human user with equipment and software is a central aspect of the work in the life science laboratory.
                 The enhancement of the usability and intuition of software and hardware products, as well as holistic interaction solutions 
                 are a demand from all stakeholders in the scientific laboratory who desire more efficient workflows. Shorter training periods,
                 parallelization of workflows, improved data integrity, and enhanced safety are only a few advantages innovative intuitive
                 human-device-interfaces can bring. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the availability of smart devices,
                 as well as unified communication protocols, holistic interaction solutions are on the rise. Future interaction in the laboratory
                 will not be limited to pushing mechanical buttons on equipment. Instead, the interplay between voice, gestures, and innovative
                 hard- and software components will drive interactions in the laboratory into a more streamlined future.},
