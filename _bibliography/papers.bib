   abstractNote={The interaction of the human user with equipment and software is a central aspect of the work in the life science laboratory.
                 The enhancement of the usability and intuition of software and hardware products, as well as holistic interaction solutions 
                 are a demand from all stakeholders in the scientific laboratory who desire more efficient workflows. Shorter training periods,
                 parallelization of workflows, improved data integrity, and enhanced safety are only a few advantages innovative intuitive
                 human-device-interfaces can bring. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the availability of smart devices,
                 as well as unified communication protocols, holistic interaction solutions are on the rise. Future interaction in the laboratory
                 will not be limited to pushing mechanical buttons on equipment. Instead, the interplay between voice, gestures, and innovative
                 hard- and software components will drive interactions in the laboratory into a more streamlined future.},

  abstractNote={Analytical measurement methods are used in different areas of production and quality control, diagnostics, environmental monitoring, or in research applications.
  If direct inline or online measurement methods are not possible, the samples taken have to be processed offline in the manual laboratory. Automated processes are increasingly
  being used to enhance throughput and improve the quality of results. In contrast to bioscreening, the degree of automation in (bio)analytical laboratories is still low.
  This is due in particular to the complexity of the processes, the required process conditions, and the complex matrices of the samples. The requirements of the process
  to be automated itself and numerous other parameters influence the selection of a suitable automation concept. Different automation strategies can be used to automate
  (bio)analytical processes. Classically, liquid handler-based systems are used. For more complex processes, systems with central robots are used to transport samples and
  labware. With the development of new collaborative robots, there will also be the possibility of distributed automation systems in the future, which will enable even more
  flexible automation and use of all subsystems. The complexity of the systems increases with the complexity of the processes to be automated.},

   ISSN={0724-6145}, 
   DOI={10.1007/10_2021_170}, 
   abstractNote={The automation of processes in all areas of the life sciences will continue to increase in the coming years due to an ever increasing number of samples
    to be processed, an increasing need to protect laboratory personnel from infectious material and increasing cost pressure. Depending on the requirements of the respective
    application, different concepts for automation systems are available, which have a different degree of automation with regard to data handling, transportation tasks, and
    the processing of the samples. Robots form a central component of these automation concepts. Classic stationary robots from the industrial sector will increasingly be
    replaced by new developments in the field of light-weight robots. In addition, mobile robots will also be of particular importance in the automation of life science 
    laboratories in the future, especially for transportation tasks between different manual and (partially) automated stations. With an increasing number of different, 
    highly diverse processes, the need for special devices and system components will also increase. This applies to both, the handling of the labware and the processing 
    of the samples. In contrast to previous automation strategies with a highly parallel approach, future developments will increasingly be characterized by individual
    sample handling.},
